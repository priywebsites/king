### Key Instructions:
- Make the website **INSANELY MODERN** — think top-tier UI/UX.
- Use **over-the-top animations** — not subtle — go big: animated headers, scroll-based transitions, parallax effects, fade-ins, hover glows, button scaling, etc.
- Do NOT go light on the animation — this site should *move*.
- Color scheme: **Black, Gray, White** — dark mode aesthetic. Minimal color. Sleek. Clean.
- Use **bold, rounded buttons** throughout. Every button should have hover effects (scale, glow, etc.).
- Include **2–3 "Book Now" buttons** that link to `tel:+17144991906` for one-tap calling on mobile.
- Make the landing page captivating with:
  - A **hero section** with the shop's name + tagline (e.g., “Kings Barber Shop — Where Precision Meets Style”)
  - A background video or parallax image of the shop interior (you can use a placeholder or a black-and-white high-end barbershop image)
  - Call-to-action button: “Book Now”
- Add a **sticky animated navigation bar** with scroll-to-section support.
- Include sections like:
  - **Services** (use sleek cards or icons)
  - **Gallery** (animated image grid or carousel)
  - **Hours & Location** (include an embedded Google Map)
  - **Contact** (with clickable phone number and address link)
- Ensure **mobile responsiveness** is flawless — the site must look sharp and feel premium on all devices.
- Use **custom fonts** (like Montserrat, Poppins, or any other modern sans-serif).
- Add **scroll-based fade-ins and animations** to text and sections.
- Use **SVG icons** for cleanliness. - also ensure all animations are mobile-first and show on mobile nicely, priority is mobile.
